Interesting Facebook discussion about the short 3-month tenure of Senate candidate Old≈ôich Hajek as dean of FAME.UTB.CZ. 

I created this backup because Facebook deleted some comments in the discussion below the article, apparently because someone reported them. 
Other web archiving tools do not work correctly with FB posts with long discussion: archive.org is failing badly, 
https://archive.ph/ASdWu is better but still not complete. 

Hopefuly Github will do better job here.
